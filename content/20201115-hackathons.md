### What is a hackathon?

And what can you learn from one? In this episode, we talk about our own experiences with hackathons!

We talk about how to go from an initial concept, to building a fully fleshed MVP in just a few days. And shortcuts we might take along the way, and how to pitch / present the idea to get teammates and win prizes! We also talk about how to pick the right tooling, and how to divide up roles to get things done!

We go into two hackathons that we've both competed in, one is a telecommunications hackathon, another is a gaming jam hackathon!
We discuss the different types of hackathons, and what you should expect out of your first one!
