### What is CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)?

And how do you use in on a webpage? In this episode we talk about how to use CSS on an HTML page. CSS Specificity Rules that control how those styles are applied, and the general workflow of how to write styles with good naming methodologies such as BEM.

Next, we talk about styling in frameworks like React. And how to debug & modify styles on the go using google chrome/firefox dev inspector tools.

Then, we go back to the basics! What is a CSS Box Model, and what are some properties you should be aware of? From there, we transition into CSS tooling such as Frameworks, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and more! We talk about responsive webdesign, and ways to achieve using media queries and calc() functions.

Lastly, we cover more CSS variables, transformation properties, and pseudoselectors! We discuss other resources we found helpful online when first learning CSS, and additional topics we'll cover in future episodes!
