### How do you transition into software development?

There's just so much information out there. It's hard to understand what employers want, and what to even start learning

In this episode, we break down our careers before development! 

German used to work worked as a restaurant manager at Zaxby's, and Vincent worked as a kitchen designer.

We discuss what resources and pitfalls we ran into when learning webdevelopment. 

And what we did once we got our first job
