A quick guide through on how this gatsby-advanced starter works:

```
gatsby-config.js -> this is your plugins, similar to wordpress plugins
gatsby-node.js -> this is the settings to point your data sources, it's an actual backend nodejs file
```

```
content -> this is where markdown files live
```
